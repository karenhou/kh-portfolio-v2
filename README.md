# My Portfolio

This is the portfolio created and designed by myself. I created this to replace my old portfolio which was made via Gatsby and also to practice using Figma(design/wireframe/mockup) and Tailwind

## Installation

```
npm i
```

## Made with

- React
- NextJS
- Tailwind
- SASS
- Sanity.io - headless CMS

## Deploy

1. upload it to github
2. connect to vercel
3. make sure to add env variable for mongodb

## Roadmap(TODOs)

- create favicon
- make it into a PWA site
