              I started out as a RIL/BSP engineer working for big corporations
              writing mostly <KeyWord>C/C++</KeyWord> creating products like
              tablet, develop broad and smart speaker. After 4 years, I decided
              I would like to venture into web development, so I enrolled online
              classes/bootcamps to prepare myself for the new career. Now I've
              worked as a fullstack developer for a startup company for two
              years; during which our internal system has submitted and granted
              patent. Our stacks for all the projects are written in{" "}
              <KeyWord>JavaScript </KeyWord>
              using framework like{" "}
              <KeyWord>ReactJS, Bootstrap, NextJS, and AWS</KeyWord> services (
              <KeyWord>lambda, EC2, DynamoDB, CloudWatch</KeyWord>). Iâ€™m also
              learning new tools (
              <KeyWord>Tailwind, Typescript, and Figma</KeyWord>) on the side
              which you can check my GitHub for more details.
